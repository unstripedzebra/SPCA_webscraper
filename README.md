# SPCA NZ Web-scraper (Python)

This program was created to scrape the SPCA website and retrieve all the information of animals currently available to adopt, based on user specifications. I used the Beautiful Soup package available in Python.

The specifications - maximum age, minimum age, species - are set when the url variable is created. 

As of 16 April 2021, the program works. However, the structure of the site may change later and the program would need to be edited to reflect those changes.

##### Story time: 

I got the idea for this program when we were looking to adopt a cat and wanted to scan all the data without needing to scroll through various pages. The current program will filter out cats above 4 months old but can be adjusted. 

Adopt if you can! :-)
